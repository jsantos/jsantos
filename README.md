## 👋 Hi there 

I'm a FullStack Developer living in Tokyo, Japan 🇯🇵.

🔭 Currently working at [TenTen](https://mytenten.co.jp/)
<br>🌱 On track to get back on the Front-End game with Reactive Rails (**StimulusReflex** + **Hotwire** + **Modern JS**).
<br>⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding I'm most likely doing a board sport 🛹🏂🏄‍♂️
<br>😄 Pronouns: He/Him

### 🛠 What I build on
👨‍💻 Ruby on Rails
<br>✨ StimulusJS, StimulusReflex, Hotwire
<br>🗺 CSS, SASS, Bootstrap
